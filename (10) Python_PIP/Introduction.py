# PIP is a package manager for Python packages, or collection of modules if you like.

# A package contains all the collection of modules and it can be referred to as library.
# Modules are Python code libraries you can include in your project.

# Packages is just like a directory of Python Scripts where each script is a so-called module.
# These modules specify functions, methods, and new Python types aimed at solving particular problems

# A code inside a package is known as source code,
