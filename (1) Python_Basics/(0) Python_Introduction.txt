PYTHON INTRODUCTION

All coding consists of three steps:
- Writing
- Executing or running
- Debugging or fixing errors

Three Technique of Controlling the Flow of Instruction in Computer:
- Sequence (instruction runs from top to bottom)
- Iteration (executing repeatedly or loop)
- Selection (choose the path to follow)

Programming languages are the tools we use to communicate with computers, instructing them to perform specific tasks. 
To effectively communicate, we need to understand the fundamental building blocks of these languages: operators and keywords. 


Python is one of the popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.

It is an interpreted programming language, means that as a developer you write Python (.py) files in a 
text editor and then put those files into the python interpreter to be executed.

It is widely used in various domain such as web development, data science, artificial intelligence, automation, game development and more.


USES AND APPLICATIONS:

1. Web and Internet Development (server-side): 
    - Python lets you develop a web application without too much trouble. 
    - It has libraries for internet protocols like HTML and XML, JSON, e-mail processing, FTP, IMAP, and easy-to-use socket interface. 
    - Yet, the package index has more libraries.

2. Scientific and Numeric Applications: 
    - This is one of the the very common applications of python programming. 
    - With its power, it comes as no surprise that python finds its place in the scientific community.

3. Python Applications in Education: 
    - Thanks to its simplicity, brevity, and large community, Python makes for a great introductory programming language. 
    - Applications of python programming in education has huge scope as it is a great language to teach in schools or even learn on your own.

4. Games and 3D Graphics: 
    - PyGame and PyKyra are two frameworks for game-development with Python. Apart from these, we also get a variety of 3D-rendering libraries.

5. Software Development Application: 
    - Software developers make use of python as a support language. 
    - They use it for build-control and management, testing, and for a lot of other things.

6. Business Applications: 
    - Python is also used to build ERP and e-commerce systems.


Purpose of Python:
- Python can be used on a server to create web applications.
- Python can be used alongside software to create workflows.
- Python can connect to database systems. It can also read and modify files.
- Python can be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics.
- Python can be used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development.


Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).

Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.
Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages.

Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. 
This means that prototyping can be very quick.

Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-oriented way or a functional way.


Python Syntax compared to other programming languages:

1. Python was designed for readability, and has some similarities to the English language with influence 
from mathematics.
2. Python uses new lines to complete a command, as opposed to other programming languages which often use 
semicolons or parentheses.
3. Python relies on indentation, using whitespace, to define scope; such as the scope of loops, functions 
and classes. Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose.


Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.
Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code. Python will give you an error if you skip the indentation.

Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation 
in Python is very important.


EIGHT BUilT-IN DATA TYPES:

In programming, data type is an important concept.
Variables can store data of different types, and different types can do different things.
Python has the following data types built-in by default, in these categories:

1. Text Type:	    str
2. Numeric Types:	int, float, complex
3. Sequence Types:	list, tuple, range
4. Mapping Type:	dict
5. Set Types:	    set, frozenset
6. None Type:	    NoneType
7. Boolean Type:	bool
8. Binary Types:	bytes, bytearray, memoryview
