# OPERANDS-BASED

# Operators in Python are symbols used for computation.
# They are the verbs of our programming language, dictating how data is processed.

# Operands (Values) refer to a value or expression that is used to perform an action or operation. 
# In other words, it is any object or data that is manipulated by an operator.

# Two types of Operators Based on Operands

# Unary Operator is an operation with only one operand.

# SAMPLE
a = -10
b = +5 

# Unary plus (+). The unary plus doesn't change the value of 'c'
c = -5
print("Unary Plus:", +c)  

# Unary minus (-). The unary minus negates the value of 'c'
print("Unary Minus:", -c)  

# Unary logical NOT (!). Logical NOT of False is True
d = False
print("Unary Logical NOT:", not d)  

# Unary bitwise NOT (~). Bitwise NOT of 1 is -2
e = 1
print("Unary Bitwise NOT:", ~e)

# Binary Operator is an operation that contains two operand.

# SAMPLE
f = 10 + 5 
print(f)
