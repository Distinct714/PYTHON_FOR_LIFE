# LIST

# List are ordered, mutable and iterable collection of elements. It allows duplicate values.
# It can be stored different data types.
# Inside the square brackets contain the elements separated by a comma.

# However, strings in variables are immutable and cannot modified it just like below.
# color = "red"
# color[0] = "m"

# A list function is where you store and organize multiple values in a single variable in orderly.

# The sample below will print an empty list.
my_list = list()
print(my_list, "\n")

# In list, an arrays are used to store multiple values in one single variable.
# It is a special variable, which can hold more than one value at a time.
# However not all arrays need similar data types.

# SAMPLE OUTPUT
list_one = [4] * 5
list_two = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]

# Concatenating lists which are similar to extend function.
def list_FirstValues():
    global list_one, list_two

    global list_one, list_two
    combined_list = list_one, list_two
    print(combined_list, "\n")

# The difference between these two functions are the concatenation operator and comma.

# List Comprehension are useful shorthands for such operations using a single line of statement.
# They are created using squared brackets.

# Using i*i as expression and "for" loop over the list in one line of statement. This is called comprehension.
# Don't forget to include square brackets when there's an expression inside the function.

# You can also add a conditional statements here.

# This offers a shorter syntax when you want to create a new list based on the values of an existing list.

# remove method removes a specified value or element inside of a list.

# clear method resets the whole list to get rid everything. It means removing all the elements inside the list.

# pop method removes or pops an element off of the list.

# index method tells if the value is present inside a variable. The output will show the position of an element.

# count method tell how many same values or not are present inside of a list.

# sort method arrange the values or elements either in ascending or alphabetical order.
color = ["Red", "Orange", "Yellow", "Green", "Blue"]

# reverse method reverse the order of a list. (Descending)
numbers = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]

# del keyword is used to delete objects. 
# In Python everything is an object, so the del keyword can also be used to delete variables, lists, or parts of a list etc.

# copy method allows to copy the exact things or value presented in a list you've created.
color = ["Red", "Orange", "Yellow", "Green", "Blue"]

# You can also apply any python functions such as conditional statements, loops and so on.
