# USE OF NUMBERS ( PYTHON MATH )

# Numerical data is a kind of information that comes in the form of numbers.

# Performing mathematical expressions using operation functions. (PEMDAS)

# If you want to convert a number into string, use "str()" function. This is casting.

# The sum() function add all the elements presented in a list or variables.
num = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# The abs() or absolute value return the value of any given or assigned number.
# Any arithmetic operators such as negative is eliminated here.

# The pow() function consist of a number and power given. It calculate the power of a given number.
# The first element is given number and second element is power.
print(pow(3, 2))

# The min() and max() function determine the lowest and highest value of a given numbers.
print(min(54, 78))

# The round() function is use to round off a given numbers or decimals.
print(round(49.6))

# The return value is an integer if ndigits is omitted or None.
# Otherwise, the return values has the same type as the number, ndigits may be negative.
# round(number, ndigits = None)
