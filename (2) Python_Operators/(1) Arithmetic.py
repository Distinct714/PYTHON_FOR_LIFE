# ARITHMETIC OPERATORS

# They are used to perform mathermatical operations such as:

# Addition - Use to add two or more values.
a, b = 4, 2
print(a + b)

# Subtraction - Use to subtract two or more values.               
c, d = 18, 9
print(c - d)

# Multiplication - Use to multiply two or more values.         
e, f = 7, 9
print(e * f)

# Division - Use to divide two or more values.         
g, h = 10, 5
print(g / h)

# Modulo - Use to find the remainder when first operand is divided by the second operand.
i, j = 11, 2
print(i % j)

# Exponentiation - Use to raise the first operand to the power of second operand.
k, l = 3, 9
print(k ** l)

# Integer/Floor division - Use to find the floor of the quotient when the first operand is divided by the second operand
# Decimal is removed automatically.
m, n = 7, 2
print(m // n)
