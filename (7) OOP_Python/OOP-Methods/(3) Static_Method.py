# STATIC METHOD

# Unlike class attributes, instance attributes are not shared by objects. 
# Every object has its own copy of the instance attribute (In case of class attributes all object refer to single copy). 
# To list the attributes of an instance/object, we have two functions:- 1.

# vars()  This function displays the attribute of an instance in the form of an dictionary.

# dir()   This function displays more attributes than vars function,as it is not limited to instance. 
#         It displays the class attributes as well. It also displays the attributes of its ancestor classes.

class Sample:
    def __init__(self):
        self.name = "None"
        self.salary = 4000

    def show(self):
        print(self.name)
        print(self.salary)

sample_info = Sample()
print("Dictionary form :", vars(sample_info))
print(dir(sample_info))

# A static method does not receive an implicit first argument. 
# A static method is also a method that is bound to the class and not the object of the class. 
# This method canâ€™t access or modify the class state. It is present in a class because it makes sense for the method to be present in class.
